I am Mijian Xu, a postdoctoral researcher fellow at University of Toronto working with [Qinya Liu](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~liuqy/). My interests include seismic tomography, full-waveform inversion, and continental dynamics. I am a core member of the [TomoATT Community](https://github.com/TomoATT) for developing open-source seismic tomography software [SurfATT](https://tomoatt.com/docs_surf/index.html), and [TomoATT](https://tomoatt.com/). I am also a maintainer of the [seispy](https://seispy.xumijian.me/) package for receiver function data processing.
